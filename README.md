# smashgg.py

## How to run

**NOTE:** In order to use properly, you will need to create an .env file with the API_TOKEN inside of it, it should look like this: 
`API_TOKEN=<insert smash.gg API token here>`
If you already have Docker installed, you may run the scripts in the /docker directory.
You need to build the container before running it, so run `build` before `run`.
If you would like to do both consecutively, you may run the `buildAndRun` script.
